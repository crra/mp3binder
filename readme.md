# About

_mp3binder_ is a simple command line utility for concatenating/join MP3 files without re-encoding.

Older mp3players e.g. stereos for children are not always capable of playing multiple files of an audio book in the correct order.

It is based on: http://www.dmulholl.com/dev/mp3cat.html and adds some more "batteries" like applying folder images and applying id3 tags.
